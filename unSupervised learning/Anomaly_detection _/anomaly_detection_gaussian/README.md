# Anomaly Detection using Gaussian Density Function

This repository contains a Python code example for performing anomaly detection using the Gaussian Density Function. The project is aimed at beginners and demonstrates how to detect anomalies in a dataset based on the Gaussian distribution. 

## Introduction

Anomaly detection is a crucial task in data analysis and machine learning. It involves identifying data points that significantly differ from the majority of the data. In this project, we use the Gaussian Density Function to model normal data behavior and detect anomalies.

## Code Explanation

The code in this repository accomplishes the following tasks:

1. **Estimate Gaussian Parameters**: We calculate the mean and variance of the dataset to build a Gaussian model of the data distribution.

2. **Multivariate Gaussian Function**: We implement the multivariate Gaussian function to compute the probability density of each data point being normal.

3. **Visualization of Gaussian Fit**: The code includes functions to visualize the Gaussian fit on a scatter plot, helping you understand how the model captures normal data behavior.

4. **Threshold Selection**: We select an optimal threshold for anomaly detection using cross-validation. This threshold helps us identify anomalies in the dataset.

5. **Anomaly Detection**: The code identifies and counts anomalies in the dataset based on the threshold.

6. **Visualization of Anomalies**: We visualize anomalies in the dataset using scatter plots, allowing you to see which data points are considered anomalies.

## Libraries Used

The code uses the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: NumPy is used for numerical operations and array manipulations. It helps in calculating means, variances, and performing matrix operations.

- **SciPy**: SciPy is used to load data from .mat files, a common format for MATLAB data.

- **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is employed for data visualization, including creating scatter plots and contour plots to visualize Gaussian fits and anomalies.

## Usage

To run this code, ensure you have Python and the required libraries (NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib) installed. Make sure the dataset files ('ex8data1.mat' and 'ex8data2.mat') are present in the same directory as the code.

Run the code, and it will perform anomaly detection on the provided datasets, showing you how to use Gaussian Density Function for this purpose.

## Conclusion

Anomaly detection is an essential skill in data analysis and machine learning. This project demonstrates how to implement anomaly detection using the Gaussian Density Function, making it accessible for beginners to understand the concept and apply it to real datasets.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it for your own datasets, and use it as a learning resource to build your anomaly detection skills.
