# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project provides a simple implementation of linear regression using Python. Linear regression is a basic machine learning algorithm that helps predict a continuous output (target) based on one or more input features. This implementation is designed to be beginner-friendly and provides insight into the inner workings of linear regression.

## Overview
This program demonstrates linear regression using gradient descent to predict profits based on the population of a city. The program consists of the following components:

1. ### Importing Modules
   The necessary modules, `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot`, are imported to handle data manipulation and visualization.

2. ### Loading Data
   The program loads data from a text file named 't.txt'. The data contains two columns: population and profit. The `numpy.loadtxt()` function is used to read the data.

3. ### Data Plotting
   The population vs. profit data points are plotted using Matplotlib for visualization.

4. ### Initializing Parameters
   Linear regression parameters (theta) are initialized as well as the feature matrix X. The feature matrix is constructed with a column of ones and the population values.

5. ### Gradient Descent
   The gradient descent algorithm is implemented to update theta iteratively, minimizing the cost function. The cost history is recorded  over iterations.

6. ### Parameter Learning and Cost
   The learned parameters (theta) and the final cost are printed.

7. ### Predictions
   Two prediction examples are demonstrated using the learned parameters and given population values.

8. ### Cost Function Plot
   The cost function's evolution over iterations is visualized using a plot.

9. ### Linear Regression Model Plot
   The linear regression model's line is plotted along with the original data points for visualization.

## Modules Used
- `numpy`: Used for efficient numerical computations and array manipulations.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Utilized for data visualization, including plotting graphs and charts.

## Intended Audience
This project is designed for beginners who are interested in understanding the fundamental concepts of linear regression, a foundational machine learning algorithm. The code's step-by-step explanation, along with comments, aims to help newcomers grasp how linear regression and gradient descent work together to create predictive models. By exploring this code, beginners can gain insights into the underlying mechanics of linear regression algorithms.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of linear regression and how it operates. Happy learning!
